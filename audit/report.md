# Portfolio-wide performance & SEO/AEO audit

_Measured headless against the current build. Regenerate with `bun run audit`. This report covers every canonical URL in the sitemap and checks document metadata and delivery. It complements the visual and editorial review of each page._

## Coverage

- Canonical pages: 144
- Pages that returned successfully: 144
- Pages that need follow-up: 0

## Document checks

- **Exactly one page heading:** 1 page(s): `/catalog/`
- **Meta description:** 1 page(s): `/catalog/`
- **Canonical URL:** all pages pass
- **Open Graph metadata:** all pages pass
- **Structured data:** all pages pass

## What the numbers mean

- **JavaScript shipped: 30kb–316kb per page** — the headline, and the "native-first" proof: heavy — investigate.
- **Bytes, JS and request counts are network-independent** — the robust, honest numbers to publish.
- **TTFB / Load are LOCAL best-case** (no network hop; max load here 462ms) — use them for catching regressions, not as absolute proof. Real-world latency adds to every stack equally.
- **The persuasive frame is comparative** — the same metrics vs Astro / Next / htmx tell the story (memory `framework-comparison-methodology`).

## Notes

- Skipped pages: none
- **Surfaces** = count of `[data-surface]` — machine-operable affordances; doubles as an AEO signal.
- **Desc / Canon / OG / JSON-LD** should now be ✓ on every page: `seo.ts` enriches every full-document
  response with a canonical URL, Open Graph + Twitter Card, and schema.org JSON-LD (Person + WebSite on
  home, BlogPosting on notes, WebPage + BreadcrumbList elsewhere), derived from each page's own
  title/description + path. A ✗ here is a regression. See memory `seo-aeo-first-class`.

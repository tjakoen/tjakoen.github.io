  <p>Teachers, on the other hand, were different. Once her story ended, it hadn’t taken Miss Weaver long to realize that I wasn’t paying attention. She called me up to the blackboard to make an example out of me. </p>
  <p>“Since you don’t feel the need to listen, why don’t you solve a problem on the board instead?” she said, sitting down at her desk. </p>
  <p>My stomach did a flip. The problem would take a minute or two to solve, and being in front of the class always made me nervous. How could I be expected to do anything when there was a spectacled frog staring me down!</p>
  <p>I stood to the right of the equation on the board so that I could check on the frog with quick glances. Despite the distraction, I did my best to focus. Halfway through, I saw that the frog had moved towards the front of the classroom. It stopped at the window by Miss Weaver’s desk. It took me a moment to figure out what it was doing. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It was trying to lift the window. </p>

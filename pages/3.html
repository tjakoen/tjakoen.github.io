    I knew all the stories by heart. The professional football player who was good at math, the politician who was a teacher’s pet; I knew every word. Instead of listening, I spent most of class drawing. I drew imaginary places, and designed creatures to fill them. Every drawing had a story. But not that day. I had barely gotten started when the frog appeared, and changed my life forever.

    I tried to listen back in to Miss Weaver, just in time to hear the end of her story about Martin Shandals, the now-famous comedian. Martin had transferred schools half way through the year, so I always felt like that one shouldn’t count. We were supposed to be learning long division, but something had reminded her of Martin. I knew exactly what bad joke she would end the story with, and much less about long division.

    “Whenever he acted up in class I’d say, ‘we’ve got a real comedian on our hands don’t we?’ And I was right!” she said with a giggle.

    I was sure Miss Weaver would see the frog eventually, but she didn’t. Nobody did. When I looked again to see if it was still there, I noticed something shiny. It made me forget all about class, and Miss Weaver and Martin Shandals. There was no denying it: the frog had put on a tiny pair of glasses.

  <h1>CHAPTER 1: Boy Meets Frog</h1>
  <p>
    The first time that I saw the frog, I was sitting in class. Its face was pressed up to the window next to me from the outside. I had been drawing in my notebook, but once I noticed it, I couldn’t stop looking. It couldn’t stop looking at me either (if it had been a staring contest, I would have lost). Maybe frogs blinked, but with its big eyes smushed against the glass, this one didn’t. Stagwood Forest was just beyond the school yard and it was riddled with frogs, but they always avoided people. I knew right away, in a way that I can think better than I can say, that this frog was different.

    Miss Weaver hadn’t noticed. She’d been my teacher for a few months, and was known for having a stack of black hair that rose a foot above her head. Before the school year started, I had heard rumors about her, and within a week I realized that they were all true. For one thing, she wore the same outfit every day; the colors changed, but she always had on striped pants and a striped jacket. For another thing, she was mind-numbingly boring. The kind of boring that makes your eyes shut without your permission. Part of the problem was that she liked to tell pointless stories instead of teaching. She was obsessed with telling stories about former students who had become famous. The first couple of times weren’t bad, even kind of interesting, but by the second week of school she had already started repeating herself, just like with her outfits.
